This is just one of the fixes if your computer has suddenly stopped recognizing TM4C123GXL microcontroller, and it does not let you reinstall the drivers.

previous version of windows.
You can also try things suggested on this website, but none of them worked for me.  https://e2e.ti.com/support/microcontrollers/other/f/908/t/397461
